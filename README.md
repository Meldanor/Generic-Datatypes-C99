This will be a library for normal datatypes like maps or vectors written in C. They are a kind of datatype independet because of using macros do define the datatype.

Usage:
Before first use you have to type something like
"DefVector(int)"
After that you can use the datatype 
"intVector" and construct it via
"intVector_construct(size)"

Same procedure for other (coming) datatypes
